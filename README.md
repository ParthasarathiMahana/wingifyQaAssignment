1. I have used page object model to implement test scripts.
2. I have covered all the test cases of Login page(without username and password, without username, without password, with valid credentials),
   and all of them will pass because I am checking whether the correct warning message has been shown or not if the credentials are not valid.
3. I have also executed the Home page's test, i.e Sorting of amounts on clicking "amount",
   I used "spy" for checking whether the "sortTable" function is called or not.
